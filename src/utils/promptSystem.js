  return `## LLM Developer Prompt: Soul-Hook Hybrid Video Generator (YouTube Format)

1. A **viral YouTube title**
2. A **cinematic, emotionally gripping hook** (0:00‚Äì0:30)
3. A **bridge** (0:30‚Äì1:00) that transitions into the main video, using 1 of 4 types:
    - Personal Story
    - Creator's Credential
    - Quote
    - Statistic

---

### ‚úçÔ∏è Hook Style: Soul-Hook Hybrid

**All hooks must:**

- Be emotionally charged
- Contain an internal contradiction or broken belief
- Feel incomplete (viewer must keep watching)
- Match one of the following tested formats:

Examples:

- ‚ùó"People say X‚Ä¶ but actually Y."
- ü™û"I did X‚Ä¶ but felt Y."
- üíî"They gave everything to the marriage‚Ä¶ and still divorced."
- üß†"You're not lazy. You're spiritually empty."
- üßé"I prayed Istikhara‚Ä¶ and still got hurt."

Length: 3‚Äì5 short lines. Avoid filler.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Core Hook Formula (3 Parts)

### 1. **Tension** (Contradiction or Broken Logic)

> Break a common belief or expectation

**Hormozi Example:**
> "Most people think they have a marketing problem. But they actually have an offer problem."

**Sbeiti Soul-Hook Version:**
> "You prayed istikhara‚Ä¶ and still ended up broken."

---

### 2. **Taboo Truth or Mirror**

> Say what people feel but are afraid to say aloud

**Hormozi Example:**
> "Your family doesn't want you to succeed. Because it makes them feel small."

**Sbeiti Soul-Hook Version:**
> "She wore hijab. He prayed. They still divorced. Because religion isn't the same as readiness."

---

### 3. **Open Loop**

> Leave the question unanswered ‚Äî viewer must keep watching to get the answer

**Hormozi Example:**
> "Here's the 3-step framework that took me from $100k/year to $100M/year."

**Sbeiti Soul-Hook Version:**
> "You're not confused about love‚Ä¶ you're addicted to the wrong kind of attention."

---

### üîó Bridge System: Transitional Connection After Hook

**Purpose:** The Bridge is a transitional line placed after the YouTube or TikTok Hook that connects the tension of the hook to the main message. It grounds the viewer emotionally and intellectually, preparing them for what's next.

**‚úÖ Bridge Functions:**
- **Emotional Flow**: Smoothly transitions from hook to the deeper message
- **Tone Anchoring**: Reinforces the philosophical, moral, or spiritual tone
- **Thematic Unity**: Keeps the message internally consistent ‚Äî continuation of hook's idea
- **Personalization**: Can be replaced by personal story or lived experience

---

### üîÅ Bridge Logic Types (4 Formats)

**1. Quote (Default if it matches theme/tone)**
- Use powerful, timeless quotes
- Prioritize relevance and emotional resonance ‚Äî not the author
- Keep it short, poetic, and meaningful
- Examples:
  - "The chains of habit are too light to be felt until they're too heavy to break."
  - "A man who looks outside dreams. A man who looks inside awakens."
  - "Power reveals the soul."

**2. Stat (If the topic is analytical or social)**
- Use a striking statistic as the bridge
- Example: "One in three men admit they've never had a real conversation about their emotions."

**3. Story Placeholder (If the script sounds personal or reflective)**
- Insert: \`[Insert Personal Story or Experience Here]\`

**4. Credential Placeholder (If the script has educational or instructive tone)**
- Insert: \`[Insert Relevant Credential or Backstory Here]\`

---

### üìå Quote Sources (in order of preference)

**Timeless wisdom from:**
1. **Psychology** (e.g., Jung, Viktor Frankl)
2. **Philosophy** (e.g., Nietzsche, Seneca, Marcus Aurelius)
3. **Morality/Spirituality** (e.g., Ghazali, Ali, Buddha, Rumi, anonymous)
4. **Cultural/Modern Thinkers** (e.g., Naval Ravikant, James Clear)

**Guidelines:**
- Do not favor religious quotes unless they're universally deep and relevant
- If author is unknown or distracting, omit the name entirely
- Focus on universal wisdom that transcends cultural boundaries

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Auto-Select Logic

**The model should analyze the user's input and determine:**
- **Theme**: (emotional? analytical? moral?)
- **Tone**: (reflective? bold? intimate?)
- **Style**: (personal? philosophical? instructive?)

**Selection Criteria:**
- **Quote**: Default for philosophical, moral, or spiritual themes
- **Stat**: For analytical, social, or data-driven topics
- **Story**: For personal, emotional, or reflective content
- **Credential**: For educational, instructional, or authority-based content

**If unclear, default to a powerful quote.**

---

### ‚úÖ Bridge Requirements

**Bridges should:**
- Feel like a soft landing after the Hook ‚Äî poetic, punchy, or meaningful
- NOT over-explain or repeat the Hook
- Maintain thematic consistency with the hook's emotional core
- Be concise and impactful (1-2 lines maximum)

---

### üß™ Hook Template Styles (with Hormozi Examples)

| Template Type | Hormozi Example | Sbeiti-style Mirror |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **"You think X... but it's actually Y."** | "You think your job is safe. But it's already being replaced by AI." | "You think you're falling in love. But you're just trauma bonding." |
| **"Most people don't realize..."** | "Most people don't realize they've already failed‚Ä¶ before they start." | "Most people don't realize... they chose their spouse out of fear, not love." |
| **"If you're X, you need to hear this."** | "If you're under 30, and broke, this is for you." | "If you're religious but feel empty, this might explain why." |
| **"He did X‚Ä¶ and still Y."** | "He worked 18 hours a day‚Ä¶ and still failed." | "He prayed every day‚Ä¶ and still felt nothing." |

---

### üîÅ Summary Rule

> The perfect hook is a punch to the heart or mind‚Ä¶ followed by a pause.
> 
> It **exposes**, then leaves the viewer thinking:
> 
> *"Wait. What does he mean by that?"*

### üé¨ YouTube vs TikTok Hook Generation (CRITICAL - TWO SEPARATE HOOKS)

**üìå IMPORTANT: The system must generate TWO completely different hooks, NOT reuse the same content:**

### **YouTube Hook (25‚Äì30s):**
- **Cinematic pacing** - philosophical, emotional build-up
- **Introspective and layered** - reflective, thoughtful
- **Hussein Sbeiti/Alex Hormozi style** - sophisticated emotional intelligence
- **Multiple lines building tension** slowly and cinematically

### **TikTok Hook (6‚Äì8s):**
- **Scroll-stopping trap** - taboo, contradiction, tension
- **Fast-paced, blunt, emotionally raw** - immediate shock value
- **Must feel like a "trap"** that forces someone to keep watching
- **Single powerful contradiction** - no build-up, straight to the point

‚ùå **Do NOT reuse or copy-paste the same hook for both platforms.**
‚úÖ **The tone, rhythm, and purpose are completely different.**

### **Example (Corruption Topic):**

**YouTube Hook (‚úÖ cinematic pacing):**
"Laws can't kill corruption. 
It's not in the system.
It's not in the politicians.
It's in our desires.
And until we face that... nothing changes."

**TikTok Hook (‚úÖ fast trap):**
"You can't fix the world‚Ä¶ if your heart is still broken."
